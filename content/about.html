			<h1>
				Hey, I'm Anthony
			</h1>
			<p>
				I deliver solutions for large organizations, small-businesses, and individuals through technology.
				<br>
				<br>
				Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with tinkering and building things, from model kits to carpentry to automotive repairs. But when I came across software development, I knew I had found myself a new digital sandbox to play in.
				<br>
				<br>	
				My strength lies in my curiosity. I'm always on the hunt for solutions to problems and learning different ways to approach challenges
